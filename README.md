# picoRhoTemp
Simple program in micropython for controling a dehumidifier with a Raspberry Pi Pico.
The USB serial connection can be used to send control data.
## Usage
Copy main.py and DHT22.py to the pico and boot it up. Default values for RH and temp thresholds are hard-coded in main.py - alter these to your liking.
